the screen.

This was made for Pirate Kart V in February 2012.

    DEPENDENCIES

Python (2.6 or later 2.x)
Pygame (1.8 or later, probably; tested with 1.9.1)

    RUNNING

./configure
./run

    PLAYING

Use the mouse or the arrow keys to move and rotate the line by clicking and
dragging so that all of the red lines around the border will cross your line
when extended.  Press space to start things moving along the red lines to find
out if you've solved the puzzle.

If a red line has a blue circle at the end, the darker arc of this indicates
the angle it will turn through when any other of the moving things crosses your
line.

    CONTROLS

left-click drag, arrow keys: move the line.
right-click drag, ctrl+left/right: rotate the line (left anticlockwise, right
                                   clockwise).
space, enter: run the puzzle.
escape, backspace: cancel running the puzzle.
tab, ctrl: hold to increase the speed when the puzzle is running.

To quit, close the window.
